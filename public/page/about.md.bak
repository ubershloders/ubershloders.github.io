            We worked with Ivan for about three years.
            He started as a junior engineer, but very quickly grew to an experienced DevOps engineer. I can admit his AWS knowledge, it’s very comprehensive and he constantly improved it.
            Ivan worked on quite large projects from the start and was responsible for their AWS architecture. I am personally, and our tech lead team was always happy with Ivan’s work.
            Overall, Ivan was a valuable team member to our company, and I wish him all the best in his future’s career.
